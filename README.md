## Usage

Build container image:

```
% docker build -t wasm-runner:local .
```

Create a sample application (example in Rust)

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Compile to wasm:

```
% rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
% rustc main.rs --target wasm32-wasip1
```

Upload `main.wasm` to a bucket for download and then run the container providing the URL to the WASM file:

```
% docker run --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e WASM_URL=https://eyevinnlab-birme.minio-minio.auto.prod.osaas.io/code/main.wasm \
  wasm-runner:local
```

The WASM application `main.wasm` can now be invoked through the HTTP server on port 8080. Provides these endpoints:

| Method | Path | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| GET    | /    | Invoke the application and return what the application writes to STDOUT |
| POST   | /    | Invoke the application and the request body is provided to the application on STDIN. Return STDOUT output |

```
% curl http://localhost:8080/
Hello, world!
```
